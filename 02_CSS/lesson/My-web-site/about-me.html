                    <p>
                        I teach at a secondary school and sixth form in West Suffolk,
                        near Bury St. Edmunds. I have been teaching Computer Science 
                        for nearly 10 years. Eight of those at my current school.
                        I try to develop a curriculum which offers all students 
                        (including girls) the chance to enjoy coding and computing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One way I try to inspire students to take up computing is 
                        through trips to computing locations. My favourite being 
                        San Francisco where we take students to visit people I know
                        at Google.

                    <p>
                        This is an organisation which helps to support teachers in 
                        primary schools to teach computing. This is through leading 
                        lessons with the teacher and showing how computing can be 
                        fun.

                        This organisation promotes computing in school. I lead community 
                        meetings which allow teachers of computing to network and share ideas.

                        the opportunity to learn to code.
