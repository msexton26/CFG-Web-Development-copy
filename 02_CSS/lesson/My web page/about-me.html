                <h2>Teaching</h2>
                <p>
                    I teach at a secondary school and sixth form in West Suffolk,
                    near Bury St. Edmunds. I have been teaching Computer Science 
                    for nearly 10 years. Eight of those at my current school.
                    I try to develop a curriculum which offers all students 
                    (including girls) the chance to enjoy coding and computing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One way I try to inspire students to take up computing is 
                    through trips to computing locations. My favourite being 
                    San Francisco where we take students to visit people I know
                    at Google.

                <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                <h3>Digital Schoolhouse</h3>
                <p>
                    This is an organisation which helps to support teachers in 
                    primary schools to teach computing. This is through leading 
                    lessons with the teacher and showing how computing can be 
                    fun.
                </p>
                <h3>Computing at School</h3>
                <p>
                    This organisation promotes computing in school. I lead community 
                    meetings which allow teachers of computing to network and share ideas.
                </p>
                <h3>Code First Girls</h3>
                <p>
                    I got involved in Code First Girls because I want to give more girls 
                    the opportunity to learn to code.
