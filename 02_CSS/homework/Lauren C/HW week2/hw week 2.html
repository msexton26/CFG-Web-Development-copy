    I decided to do Code First Girls to break into the tech industry. Doing my masters, I realized I really enjoy research, but I didn't want to pursue a career in that field. However, I have always been really interested in tech but I have never really been given a chance to actually learn how to do any of it. So I finally took matters into my own hands and signed up for a course!
